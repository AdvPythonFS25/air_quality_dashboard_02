### Progress
In the first week we managed to create a running prototype of our application with rudimentary functionalities.
In the second week we updated our project added some features: the user can input any city and time span to get a graph of the selected polutants as well as the maximum value of the polutant. In addition we refactored our code.
In the third week we added some unit tests and refactored the new features from week 2.
In the last week we created a virtual environment for our project.
