# 🌍 WHO Air Quality Dashboard
This project was created as part of the course *Programming for Data Sciences* by students of the university of Bern.
We've worked on creating a simple interactive dashboard for exploring air quality data across countries and cities, 
using data from the **World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory**.

# 📊 Data
The WHO Ambient Air Quality Database compiles data on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), particulate matter of a diameter equal or smaller than 10 μm (PM10) or equal or smaller than 2.5 μm 
(PM2.5) which aim at representing an average for the city or town as a whole, rather than for individual stations. 
Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion. In order to present 
air quality data that represent human exposure, we used mainly urban measurements, comprising urban background, 
residential areas, commercial and mixed areas or rural areas and industrial areas close to urban settlements.
