# Notes

## General Information
I suggest we use use [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) for creating our dashboard, I already included some basic scaffolding but we can always change that.


## Dependancy management
since this is a fairly small project i just added a requirements.txt to manage our dependancies, simply update them with:

```pip freeze > requirements.txt```

or load them with:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
